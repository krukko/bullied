New files should be added to their respective branches:
  Arts Branch: New Game Arts and textures
  Bugfix Branch: Bugfixes to the game, code-wise only
  Levels Branch: Game Level changes should be done here
  Master Branch: Should not be touch unless you know what you are doing
  
If you are unclear about anything for branches and repositories, just ask Pei Sheng.
